        Hello! I'm Eric Liski, a software engineering student at LUT University.
        I have a strong passion for technology and programming. During my
        studies, I've focused on learning languages Python, C, Java, and
        JavaScript and I've enjoyed working on projects that involve web
        development and software applications. I believe in the power of
        technology to solve real-world problems and improve lives. Outside of
        academics, I enjoy exploring new programming concepts, playing video
        games, and staying active with friends. I'm excited about the future of
        software engineering and eager to contribute to innovative projects that
        make a difference.

        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Software
        Engineering at Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) in Finland,
        with an expected graduation in 2026. My academic journey has included
        in-depth courses such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems
        and System Programming, Cyber Security of Software Systems, Advanced Web
        Applications, Introduction to Databases, Database Systems Management,
        and Computer Networks & Internet. Additionally, I completed the Cyber
        Security Base 2023 program at Helsingin yliopiston MOOC-keskus. This
        comprehensive course covered fundamental topics in cybersecurity,
        including securing software, to enhance my knowledge in this critical
        field.

        I have developed a MEAN-Stack social media web application leveraging
        MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js. Key features include robust
        user authentication with JWT for secure access and data integrity, a
        dynamic timeline for user posts, and an advanced search functionality.
        Another Web Development project I have created is a MERN-Stack dating
        application using React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This project
        includes secure user authentication, profile management capabilities,
        and a user-friendly interface similar to popular dating platforms. I
        have also done more system programming orianted projects such as
        redesigned essential Unix commands such as 'zip' and 'unzip' in C,
        implementing parallel processing techniques and integrating Run-Length
        Encoding for enhanced data compression efficiency.
